    <h2>Potential Trader Matching</h2>
    <p>The Trading platform will provide Home Brew Traders (HBT) members to trade beer with other HBT members. Rather than spending your precious time to search throguh the trove of shared beer brewed by HBT members, Trade matching will connect you to brewers that you will want to connect to and trade with. </p>
    <p>The logged in member will be matched with a another member from HBT. The Matches will be calculated from the following values:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Location</li>
      <li>Member Rating</li>
      <li>Ratio</li>
      <li>Date</li>
      <li>Stock Availability</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Location</h3>
    <p>The logged in user from HBT will only be able to see matches from other HBT members that are within 50km from there location set in their account. The Havesine function will be used to calculate the distance from latitude and longitude inputs. These inputs are gathered on the join page.</p>
    <h3>Member Rating</h3>
    <p>The member rating is the mean rating from all their brew reviews. A brew review can only be undertaken by another member that has requested a certain amout of beer, and the request has been accepted. The rating will be either {0,1,2,3,4,5}. 0 being terrible, and 5 being unmatchable in awesomeness!</p>
    <h3>Ratio</h3>
    <p>The ratio updates when a the logged in user accepts a brew request, or one of their own request for beer gets accepted. The amount of litres out from the logged in user is added to 'beer out'. The amount of beer in litres that the logged in user gets from other HBT members, is added to 'beer in'.</p>
    <p>e.g. You've given out 25L of beer, but you've only recived 20L. Then your ratio is 25/20 R(1.25). You are owed beer from the community.</p>
    <p>On the other hand you've given out 10L of beer, and have recieved 25L then you are in defecit 10/25 R(0.4). Anything below 0.5 then you will return no matches until you increase your ratio.</p>
    <p>Once you get to higher amount values, the ratios become unruly. So an absolute deficit cap of 30L is in place. So the limit takes place at which ever comes first, the ratio(0.5) or the absolute cap (30L).</p> 
    <h3>Date</h3>
    <p>As all homebrew beer should be fresh, matches only appear if the bottling date is within the designated date range. <ul><li>The past:  Will only match beers less than 9 months of bottling.</li><li>The future: Will place higher priority on beers closer to the bottling date, less priority for those bottled far in the future.</li></ul>This data is gathered when the logged in user adds a new brew.</p>
    <h3>Stock Availability</h3>
    <p>The mathing will only return results if the other member has a brew amount that is more than 0, and less then or equal to their supplied amount. When the logged in user accepts a brew request, the amount decreases accoringly. There are three Stock Availability states: <ol><li>Out of Stock</li><li>Limited Availability</li><li>In Stock</li></ol>The initial stock amount in litres is entered when the logged in user adds a new brew.</p>
